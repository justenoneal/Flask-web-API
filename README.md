# Flask web API
 I'm following the tutorial at https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask

 This simple api that will eventually return book data stored in an SQLite database

going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books/all returns mock data stored in the app
in JSON format
